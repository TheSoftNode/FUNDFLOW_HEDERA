## Contract Overview

### Core Contracts

1. **FundFlowCore.sol** - Main platform contract integrating all functionality
2. **CampaignManager.sol** - Manages campaign creation, updates, and lifecycle
3. **InvestmentManager.sol** - Handles all investment-related operations
4. **MilestoneManager.sol** - Manages milestone creation, voting, and execution

### Governance Contracts

1. **GovernanceManager.sol** - Implements decentralized governance and voting

### Analytics Contracts

1. **AnalyticsManager.sol** - Provides analytics, reporting, and risk assessment

### Interface Contracts

All contracts implement well-defined interfaces that specify the contract APIs:

- **IFundFlowCore** - Core platform interface
- **ICampaignManager** - Campaign management interface
- **IInvestmentManager** - Investment operations interface
- **IMilestoneManager** - Milestone management interface
- **IGovernanceManager** - Governance and voting interface
- **IAnalyticsManager** - Analytics and reporting interface

### Library Contracts

Reusable libraries containing business logic:

- **CampaignLibrary** - Campaign validation and utility functions
- **InvestmentLibrary** - Investment calculations and validations
- **MilestoneLibrary** - Milestone voting and execution logic
- **GovernanceLibrary** - Governance calculations and validations
- **AnalyticsLibrary** - Statistical analysis and trend calculations

## Key Features

### Enterprise-Grade Architecture

- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Interface-based architecture for upgradeability
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Gas-optimized implementations

### Hedera-Specific Optimizations

- HBAR native token support
- Efficient storage patterns for Hedera's consensus mechanism
- Optimized for Hedera's transaction model

### Security Features

- ReentrancyGuard protection
- Pausable functionality for emergency stops
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

### Advanced Functionality

- Milestone-based funding with investor voting
- Equity token distribution
- Governance proposals and voting
- Real-time analytics and risk assessment
- Automated compliance checking

## Deployment Notes

1. Deploy contracts in the following order:

   - Libraries first
   - Core contracts
   - Manager contracts
   - Link all contracts together

2. Configure platform parameters:

   - Platform fee percentages
   - Minimum/maximum campaign amounts
   - Governance parameters
   - Analytics thresholds

3. Set up proper access controls and admin roles

## Integration

The contracts are designed to work together as a cohesive platform while maintaining modularity for future upgrades and extensions.

## Testing

Test files should be placed in the `test/` directory following Hardhat testing conventions for Hedera development.
